Oh yea
Come on
You get the limo out front
Hottest styles, every shoe, every color
Yea when your famous it can be kinda fun
It's really you but no one ever discovers
In some ways you're just like all your friends
But on stage you're a star
You get the best of both worlds
Chillin' out, take it slow
Then you rock out the show
You get the best of both worlds
Mix it all together and you know that
It's the best of both worlds
The best of both worlds

I'm more than just
Your average girl
I'd like to turn me up
And show the world

Aw yeah!

Cause some can talk the talk
This girl just wants to rock
I'm individual
I'm not like anyone

I can be glamorous
Just like you see in all the magazines
I can be cool as ice
Or anything I want to be

Who said, who said I can't be Superman
I say, I say that I know I can
Who said, who said I won't be President
I say, I say you ain't seen nothin' yet

Oh yeah. Yeah

Go on and make some noise
Every girl has a choice
To lead their own parade
I do it my way

Ow!

I can be soft and sweet
Or louder than the radio (radio)
I can be sophisticated
Or totally go (totally go) out of control

Who said, who said I can't be Superman
I say, I say that I know I can
Who said, who said I'm not electrified
I say, I say

There's no holdin' back
Stayin' right on track
Cause you control the game
So let them know your name

No limitations on imagination
Imagine that

Yeah!

Who said, who said I can't be worldwide
I say, I say time is on my side
Who said, who said I can't be ten feet tall
I say, I say that I can have it all

Who said, who said I can't be Superman
I say, I say that I know I can
Who said, who said I won't be President
I say, I say you ain't seen nothin' yet you ain't seen nothing yet

Wowww
Yeahhhh!

Who said

Come on

Yeah

That's right

(yeah, yeah)
So what you see
Is only half the story
There's another side of me
I'm the girl you know
But I'm someone else too
If you only knew

It's a crazy life
But I'm alright

I got everything I've always wanted
Living the dream
So yeah, everything I've always wanted
isn't always what it seems
I'm a lucky girl
Whose dreams came true
But underneath it all
I'm just like you

(yeah, yeah)

Don't wanna be treated differently
I wanna keep it all inside
Half the time I've got my name in lights
The other half I'm by your side

It's a crazy life
But I'm just fine

I got everything I've always wanted
Living the dream
So yeah, everything I've always wanted
isn't always what it seems
I'm a lucky girl
Whose dreams came true
But underneath it all
I'm just like you

Yeah-ee yeah

Can't you see
I'm just an ordinary girl
Living in an extra-ordinary world
Trying to live
Trying to learn
Trying to just be who I am
Who I am

I got everything I've always wanted
Living the dream (the dream)
So yeah, everything I've always wanted (always wanted)
isn't always what it seems
I'm a lucky girl
Whose dreams came true
But underneath it all
I'm just like you

I got everything I've always wanted
Living the dream (livin' the dream)
So yeah, everything I've always wanted (always wanted)
isn't always what it seems
I'm a lucky girl
Whose dreams came true
But underneath it all
I'm just like you

Hey
Get up
Get loud
Start pumpin' up the party now [x2]

It's the same old, same grind
But we don't feel we're wasting time
Not so bored that we can't find a better way
My friends, my kind
No one's gettin' left behind
If they did it'd be a crime
That's why we say
Let the music start a revolution
No time to play it safe

Hey
Get up
Get loud
Start pumpin' up the party now [x2]

They can't
We can
Parents might not understand
Having fun without a plan
But that's what we do
We're all here (Let's go!)
Gotta make this party grow
Together we can make it blow
Right through the roof
The music's gonna start a revolution
Too late to play it safe

Hey
Get up
Get loud
Start pumpin' up the party now [x2]

We don't have to paint by numbers
Let our voice come out from under
Hear it rise
Feel the thunder
It's time to lose control

Hey
Get up
Get loud
Start pumpin' up the party now [x2]
Pumpin' up the party now
Party now, party now

Hey
Get up
Get loud
Start pumpin' up the party now [x4]

Uh oh
There you go again talking cinematic
Yeah you!
You're charming, got everybody star struck.
I know
How you always seem to go
For the obvious instead of me
But get a ticket and you'll see

[Chorus:]
If we were a movie
You'd be the right guy
And I'd be the best friend
You'd fall in love with
In the end we'd be laughing
Watching the sunset
Fade to black
Show the names
Play that happy song

(Yeah)
Yeah, yeah
When you call me
I can hear it in your voice
Oh sure!
Wanna see me
And tell me all about her
La la
I'll be acting through my tears
I guess you'll never know
That I should win
An Oscar for this scene I'm in

[Chorus]

Wish I could tell you there's a twist
Some kind of hero in disguise
And we're together
It's for real
Now playing
Wish I could tell you there's a kiss
Like something more than in my mind
I see it
Could be amazing

[Chorus x3]

We haven't met
And that's OK
'cause you will be asking for me one day
Don't want to wait
In line

The moment is mine believe me

Don't close your eyes
'cause it's a chance worth takin'
And I think that I can shake you

I know where I stand
I know who I am
I would never run away when life gets bad, it's
Everything I see
Every part of me
Gonna get what I deserve
I got nerve (I got I got I got)

Electrified, I'm on a wire
Getting together we're on fire
What I said you heard
Now I got you spinning

Don't close your mind
The words I use are open
And I think that I can show you

I know where I stand
I know who I am
I would never run away when life gets bad, it's
Everything I see
Every part of me
I know I can change the world, yeah, yeah, yeah
I know what you like
I know what you think
Not afraid to stare you down until you blink, it's
Everything I see
Every part of me
Gonna get what I deserve
I got nerve

You, you need to discover
Who can make you feel free
And I, I need to uncover
The part of you that's reaching out for me, hey

I know where I stand, I know who I am
I would never run away when life gets bad
It's everything I see, every part of me
I know I can change the world yeah yeah yeah

I know what you like, I know what you think
Not afraid to stare you down until you blink
It's everything I see, every part of me
Gonna get what I deserve, I got nerve

(I'm what you want, I'm what you need)
Yeah yeah yeah, I got nerve
(I'm what you want, I'm what you need)

I know what you like, I know what you think
Not afraid to stare you down until you blink
It's everything I see, every part of me
Gonna get what I deserve
I got, I got nerve
The other side
The other side
The other side of me

By day, I play
The part in every way
Of simple sweet, calm and collected

Pretend, to my friends
I'm a chameleon
Can make a girl feel disconnected

Feel like a star
A super hero
Sometimes it's hard to separate
(Got too much on my plate)

If you could see
The other side of me
I'm just like anybody else, can't you tell
I hold the key (the key)
To both realities
The girl that I want you to know
If only I could show
The other side...the other side
I want you to see
The other side...the other side
The other side of me

Inside, I try
To make the pieces fit right
A jigsaw puzzle everywhere
'Cause I flip the script
So many times I forget
Who's on stage, who's in the mirror

Back in the spotlight
The crowd is calling
The paparazzi and the fame
(It can drive a girl insane)

If you could see
The other side of me
I'm just like anybody else, can't you tell
I hold the key
To both realities
The girl that I want you to know
If only I could show
The other side...the other side
I want you to see
The other side...the other side
The other side of me

Down inside I'm not that different
Like everyone I have a dream
Don't wanna hide just wanna fit in
Sometimes it's harder than it seems

If you could see
The other side of me
I'm just like anybody else, can't you tell
I hold the key
To both realities
The girl that I want you to know

If you could see
The other side of me
I'm just like anybody else, can't you tell
I hold the key (the key)
To both realities
The girl that I want you to know
If only I could show (yeah)

The other side...the other side
I want you to see (yeah!)
The other side...the other side
The other side of me

The other side...the other side
I want you to see
The other side..the other side of me
