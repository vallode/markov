Look for me
Lost in a whirlwind, 2012 quality
High up until the world end, doing eighty-five in my ride
And these niggas hiding, know I'm striding like a giant
I ain't lying when I'm rhyming, rule these niggas like a tyrant
Damn, Doms, it don't even seem like you trying
Know these niggas crucify 'em, couldn't crack him I'm a diamond
I know that niggas is finding my progression so uncommon
The pressure I'm still applying until I hear the angels crying
Sad day in Hell for those who doubted, hope your head explode
Cry about it, but don't deny that Doms got the realest flows
My eyes is feeling low, pulling on the killer 'dro
Chilling with a vixen, thinking "This is what I did it for"
Still banging, Wolf Ganging as if you niggas didn't know
Still trife and Loiter Litter Life and triple sixing, ho

Doms, while they ripping through the packaging to grab the shit
I'm shaded with the few whom I usually blow cabbage with
New patterns patty-caking with mannequins
Cause I don't like my fucking homies dip, bruh, they all
Jaw-slacking, all 'em awe struck
And I ain't got shit but a pretty bitch and cigar tucks
Riding in the city and knocking out in the Starbucks
I swear these niggas is fucking phony, smoking spliffs and that's
Prior to arriving to the studio
Eyes glued to a gluteus maximus, attractive lady
Where you headed with that shit?
And can a real nigga get a look at it? Crook, panic-shook
Ain't ya? Blunt fatter than some butch ankles
Cheffing, fit the cook apron, ante up for good payment
Run until my foot achy, running 'till my foot aching
Full-grown terror type, Ferragamo do-rag
With my nigga Travy out in Maui, running two-mans
Smoking 'till I'm loopy as a motherfucking toucan
20 minutes, burn a fucking quarter back to two grams
But I'mma dip, I know you must have had it with my rude ass

Yea I'm your new fetish
Rip through cyphers like rabbits chew lettuce
Young black fresh: Hugh Hef, you said it
Grinding with your girl while you're posted, two steppin' (you said it)
Pen in my right, mic in my left fist
Flow got more bang than two weapons
Undetected I'm the best: no question, who said it?
Couldn't find your style with two fuckin' detectives
Straight to the top please no Prerequi-sites
I'm the shit's that's on ya face like zits
Cocky bastard, disappear when the 3/8 hits
Back and forth pacing, got no patience
Pulse racin' I'm amazin' as grace is, fuck Satan (uhh)
Leave this pussy ass with his face caved in
Face it, this adolescent's presence leaves messes keep stepping
Rep niggas with no rep, ho's separate
Niggas with no breath
Ain't no real kin of me
I'm clever, my endeavor sever several wannabes
I'm chilly, got the girls giddy, my flow silly
Roll with me and your crew ain't nothing but four 50's (Ouch!)
Hadn't noticed, that's a mid-200
Me and my crew, both of them, powered in two tundras
Open up your eyes, witness the boy wonder (open em up!)
Fire flow comparable to two summers
Strike like lightning and I don't need thunder

Let's be honest cause truthfully
At the rate I'm moving, you gonna to have to get used to me
This sauce is the weakest, tang and my three step
Often rejected cause I reject the reject
Garage band flow needs no reasoning
Y'all niggas tasteless, beef no seasoning
C4's eating them proceed to the exit
Ends with a L-Y, starts with a S, yes
Him without a winner is Clark Kent without a cleft chin
Superman reference of how high I keep stepping
Whoa, I go harder than standardized testing
Bars on lock my developments arrested
I'm the bestest, on a bad day I spit asbestos
Yeah, yes, impressive y'all steady coming in second
Fuck V-necks I'm the rapper to invest in
My flow ends recessions, I'm fresh as Crest breath is
Kay, I'm tryna tell you I'm superior
Cardiac flow what you're hearing in my material is heart
Covered in ego, I freeze MCs zero degrees below
When it's comes to alter-ego's, I got at least four
But they the reason I'm always ready, listo
Aight I'm Sly-lingual, eyes on the prize, I'm fly make eyes twinkle
I been dope, put it on your grandmother's wrinkles
Chip on my shoulder like I'm dieting with Pringles
I brush it off quick like H to the O-V
Life is but a beach chair these nigga's folding

Aw, nigga thought he killed me?
Alright, that's cool, we'll see

Strict top of the crop shit
Crushin' muthafuckas like moths in a mosh pit
Dollar cents since shit, sense I ain't lost it
It's in a fuckin' jar with guitar picks and bar spit
Bar spat, past tense, warriors of radness
Fuck lame, get it through your brain like dad's dick
Go ahead, stab a friend, tell him that I'm back, bitch
Earl leave bastards with milkiest asses
Take a firm standin', nine on the tracklist
Earl half the reason the reviews fantastic
Niggas gettin' comfy on the couch, I ain't havin' it
Kickin' gluteus maximus, killin' niggas on accident

Just watch, I'mma kill 'em all
Just watch, I'mma kill 'em all
Just watch, I'mma kill 'em all
Just watch, off 'em!

Off 'em, no off days, no debates, bitch
Box logo, switchblade and cocaine
In my back pocket, take Jade on vacation
The hotel switch from Heartbreak to Bates quick
Rippin' out braids with bare hands amazes
The crowd, go crazy, hands raised, I'm laced with
Swag by the eighth in case you wanna taste it
Faggots wear Prada, Satan wears RMK shit
Hell's angel, crack Christ 'cross the face
With erasers and use Based God as his replacement
Super Saiyan with ruthless slayings
Eat puss, sweet puss got my tooth decayin'

Now pan the cameras back to me and Pamela's
Amateur threesome with Hannah Montana's manager
And Miley feedin' me sandwiches for my stamina
And Santa's in the back laughin' cause my back's crampin' up
Mrs. Claus trippin' balls, think she had enough
And by enough I mean we dope as fuck, she had a gram of us
Flyer than your man because I'm lampin' up
At the airport smokin' hash with all the fuckin' baggage handlers
Flowin' like the muthafuckin' aqueducts
Odd Future Wolf Gang, fag damagers, bitch, eat a dick
